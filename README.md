PROJECT GOALS:
Create an informative and interactive system that shares information about you and your friends. This system should use a programming language/environment agreed upon by your team – but the actual development should be completed by individually. This can be a mobile application or a web- based system; both need some form of database connectivity.

1. Create an account.
2. Log in with a valid username and password.
3. Logout and allow other users to log in.
4. Update profile information (username, password, and all the information displayed on the various tabs/button/delineations within the system).
5. (Extra Credit - Stretch Goals): Share your profile with other users in the system; create friend lists; allow friends to suggest edits to the “All About Me” system content.
6. (Extra Credit – Stretch Goals): Upload and store pictures in the system database.
